# MJML.NET
An un-official port of [MailJets MJML](https://mjml.io/) to [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard). This project is currently in **experimental state** and should not be used in a production environment. 

## Introduction

`MJML` is a markup language created by [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) and designed to reduce the pain of coding a responsive email. Its semantic syntax makes the language easy and straightforward while its rich standard components library shortens your development time and lightens your email codebase. MJMLâ€™s open-source engine takes care of translating the `MJML` you wrote into responsive HTML.

## Status
`MJML.NET` tries to implement all functionality `1-2-1` with the MJML 4 project. However, due to JavaScript not being a typed language this means there has been considerate refactoring to the code to make it more aligned with C# typed requirements. 

As the project is currently still in experimental state not all MJML components have been added. Please see the below table for a list of all components and the current implementation state:
